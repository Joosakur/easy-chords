            intended especially for those who can not play with a normal keyboard due to lack of
            skill or some disability.

          <p className="text-high">
            You can use the built-in sounds to instantly play and try out ideas anywhere - even on
            the road with mobile.
          </p>

      <H2>Playing chords</H2>
      <p className="text-high">
        Just click on them! When using external MIDI, the chord is played until you release the
        mouse button, velocity is controlled by horizontal position of the click, and space bar will
        work as a sustain pedal.
